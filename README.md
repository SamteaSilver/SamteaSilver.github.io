# Project Name

Pokemon Data Search 

## Frameworks

Built using React + Vite

## Description

This is a website that lets users search up information about Pokemon. The information included are the Pokemon's name, type(s), pokedex entry number, pokedex description, height & weight, the category of the pokemon, and its abilities.

## Installation

The website is up on {website link} and {github link}

## API used

I used the pokeapi which has information on all things Pokemon. I specifically used the https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name or id}/ and the
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/{name or id}/ endpoints for this project. 

## Struggles

I really struggled with displaying the different Pokedex entry description since with each generation of Pokemon the order of the languages differs. I initially tried to use ternary to change the placeholder variable based on the pokedex id but after getting guidance from my instructor, I learned that a simple function would better suit this scenario. 

## Improvements

- Display ability info on hover

- Display a fun fact about each pokemon somehow

- Display the shiny form of each pokemon using toggle ?
